# M2 - Formal Modelling

Made as a project for the following :

* School : Efrei Paris - Semester 9 in Software Engineering
* Course : Formal Modelling
* Goal : Emulate the logistic of an hospital (visitor entries / departure, staff, resources)



## The Project

### Getting Started
No need for configuration ! Simply double-click on :
```
HospitalSimulation/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/HospitalSimulation.exe
```


### The Structure
The project is built around :
* JSON files : 
  * some contain the data for each Hospital (name, capacities, doctors / nurses / rooms...)
  *  one contains the detail of the route of each visitor (name, time spend, resources required, resources freed...)
  *  
* Semaphores for all the resources (visitor, staff, room...)

Simply laucnh the project and watch the automation make its job ^^
